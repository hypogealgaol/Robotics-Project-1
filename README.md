robot follows a path generated by a convex hull algorithm

The convex hull is generated using the TSP algorithm (which can also be found on my GitHub).

We then used the convex hull and generated a visibility map. The coordinates and obstacles were
pre-drawn and we used the algorithm to create the hull, then used each vertex to find all visible angles.

Then we simply used a shortest-path algorithm to get to the goal the fastest.

Fun fact: We participated in a Roomba Race using this algorithm and we won 3rd place.
We got a little dog shaped mp3 player that wags its head :)
